A web project for reviewing GBA games (such as Harvest Moon, Pokémon, etc.) designed for Dicoding submission, focusing on the implementation of semantic HTML, Flexbox layout, and responsive design. The site includes interactive JavaScript features like a hamburger menu and fade-in animations using the Intersection Observer API, all built with pure code without external libraries to meet maximum evaluation criteria.
Technologies used: HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox & Variables), and Vanilla JavaScript.
